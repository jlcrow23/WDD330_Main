My ideas for my project are:
1. Jensen's Grove Park
2. Crafty Website

For #1:
This would be geared toward families or individuals who like to boat,
swim, fish, or walk locally.
I would use API to put in a map of the area.
Local Storage might be pictures of the activities to do.
I would add in animations to make it more appealing.

For #2:
This would be geared toward people who like to be crafty and learn new
skills.
I would use API to allow examples of ideas to be put on the site.
I would have videos and interactive steps to help people learn.
I would have lots of color and would show how to do a lot of activities.
